## NASA archive images

In order to find variations in the surface area of water bodies we compared pictures taken by Astro Pi Izzyâ€™s near-infrared camera to archive images from NASA World View on-line services.

With the area measurement tool from Nasa World View we found out the evolution of water surface area of Lake Aral's western basin for each year since 2000. Then we compiled the images into an animated gif file.
