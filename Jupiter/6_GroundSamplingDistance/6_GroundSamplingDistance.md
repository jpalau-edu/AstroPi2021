## Ground sampling distance

To, we estimated the area covered by a single pixel based on the ground sampling distance method 

SW (sensor width) =3,76mm
FR (Focal length) = 3,6mm
H (ISS height) ~ 419833m
DW(distance covered in width direction)

Equally:
SH (sensor height) =2,74mm
FR(Focal length) = 3,6mm
DH(distance covered in height direction)

IW (image width) = 2592 px
IH (image height) = 1944 px
