## Ground sampling distance

To, we estimated the area covered by a single pixel based on the ground sampling distance method 

* SW (sensor width) =3,76mm
* FR (Focal length) = 3,6mm
* H (ISS height) ~ 419833m
* DW(distance covered in width direction)

* Equally:
* SH (sensor height) =2,74mm
* FR(Focal length) = 3,6mm
* DH(distance covered in height direction)

IW (image width) = 2592 px
IH (image height) = 1944 px
