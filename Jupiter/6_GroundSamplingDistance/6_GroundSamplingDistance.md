## Ground sampling distance

To estimated the area covered by a single pixel based on the [ground sampling distance](http://gsp.humboldt.edu/OLM/Courses/GSP_216_Online/lesson2-2/scale.html) we need

* SW (sensor width) =3,76mm
* FR (Focal length) = 3,6mm
* H (ISS height) ~ 419833m
* DW(distance covered in width direction)

* SH (sensor height) =2,74mm
* FR(Focal length) = 3,6mm
* DH(distance covered in height direction)

* IW (image width) = 2592 px
* IH (image height) = 1944 px

### To find out [ISS height on April 24th](https://www.heavens-above.com/IssHeight.aspx?lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT)

Width April 1st to April 30th: 55 px

30 days -> 55px
24 days -> Xpx

Width April 24th: 44px


Height full division: 67px

Proportional Hight: 39px

67px -> 0,4km
39px -> Xkm

Proportional Hight = 0,232835821 km

ISS Height: 419.6 + 0,2328 km
