## Ground sampling distance

To estimated the area covered by a single pixel based on the ground sampling distance method we need

* SW (sensor width) =3,76mm
* FR (Focal length) = 3,6mm
* H (ISS height) ~ 419833m
* DW(distance covered in width direction)

* SH (sensor height) =2,74mm
* FR(Focal length) = 3,6mm
* DH(distance covered in height direction)

* IW (image width) = 2592 px
* IH (image height) = 1944 px

Width April 1 to 30: 55 px

55px -> 30 days

Xpx  -> 24 days

Width April 24th: 44px


Height full division: 67px

Proportional Hight: 39px

67px -> 0,4km

39px -> Xkm

Proportional Hight = 0,232835821 km


ISS Height: 419.6 + 0,2328 km
