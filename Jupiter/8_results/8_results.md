From ground sampling distance method we got a pixel size of 169,17 x 164,37 = 27807m² per pixel. 

Finally, we used  ImageJ  image processing software from NIH to find the aggregate area in pixels which turned out to be 7661-86 = 7575 pixels.

Bear in mind that before we can use the combined number of pixels we have to compensate for the shrinking Infragram did to our image: 2592/800 = 1944/600 = 3,24 so the amount of pixels have to be factored by 3,24² that is 7575 x 3,24² = 79519px at  27807m² per pixel which makes up an area of 2211,2 Km².

With the area measurement tool from Nasa World View we found out the evolution of water surface area for western basin for each year since 2000 (Fig-6).

Subsequently, measured areas were entered in a spreadsheet and assessed to calculate a yearly surface loss average which happened to be 4,1%. This average was eventually fed into the Compound Interest Formula as a negative rate in order to compute how long it would take for the water surface to drop below 100 Km² given the aforementioned rate remained constant. As shown in the results, in just under 75 years Lake Aral could be on the brink of disappearance.
