# 2. Getting correction factors to sense-hat readings

We run Once 1_testDHT22_getFACTORS.py a second time and use the generated data sets to get corresponding correction factors to correlate sense-hat readings to actual values.

We merged individual spreadsheets in the workbook
>2_getFACTORS.xlsx

where factor calculations can be found.
