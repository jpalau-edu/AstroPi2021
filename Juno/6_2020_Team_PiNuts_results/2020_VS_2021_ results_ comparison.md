## 2020 vs 2021 results comparison

From 2021 AstroPi data we've got average CPU temperature, sense-hat temperature and humidity values of
>av. cpu_temp: 34.94ºC (!!!)

>av. sense_temp: 30.65ºC (!!!)

>av. sense_hum: 32.81ºC (!!!)

From our testing series we've got average temperature and humidity factors values
>av. temp_factor: 1.92

>av. hum_factor: 0.22


Oddly enough, the CPU and sense-hat data we've got this year differ much from those of last year's edition. For instance, 2020 averages were 30.4ºC, 26.26ºC and 42.28% for CPU temperature, sense-hat temperature and sense-hat humidity, respectively. Regarding temperature and humidity correction factors we got 2.13 and 0.78, respectively.
